        I'm Daniel, a self-taught programmer who is actually
        working in some stuff with Django. I'm not pretty sure about
        which field I wanna work in Â¿Pentesting, Fullstack web, Data Analyst,
        Mobile development?
        I'm not sure yet, but I know I wanna be a programmer and I'm only 16,
        and for the moment I wanna have knowledge in almost all fields and,
        once I tried all spheres, I'll specialize.
